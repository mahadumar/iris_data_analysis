# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Task Objective
The goal of this task was to explore the Iris dataset using Python and perform basic EDA (exploratory data analysis) using visualization libraries like seaborn and matplotlib.

## Dataset Used
- Dataset: [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
- Source: Loaded directly via `seaborn` as a built-in dataset.

## Models Applied
No machine learning model applied in this task. This task focused on:
- Understanding dataset structure
- Visualizing feature relationships using:
  - Scatter plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots

## Key Results & Findings
- The petal measurements show better separation between species compared to sepal measurements.
- Versicolor and virginica species have overlapping sepal dimensions, but distinct petal dimensions.
- The dataset is balanced and clean, making it ideal for ML model training later.

## Files
- `iris_analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook with all code and visualizations.
